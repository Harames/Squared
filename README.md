# Squared

Currently ceased devolopment, probably won't resume, ever

I am porting this http://pkmninja.itch.io/squared from Game Maker 7 to Game Maker Studio Professional.
I am also hoping to have andriod support.

Until I finish porting all of the old code, please don't pull requests.
I would greatly appreciate your help with art and code once I finish porting everything.

Phase 1 (15% done):
Get basic art and all important objects coded
(I have just finished survival mode, it now works. Now to add power-up objects and timed mode.)
Phase 2:
Get better art and try to make the game more compatible with Andriod

Phase 3:
Finish Andriod optimization
